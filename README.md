### Hello everyone!
For those unfamiliar with my work, I'll tell you a little about myself.  
I'm a 16 year old programmer who enjoys breaking things, mostly for research purposes.

### [Ragnarok](https://github.com/Ragnarok-framework)
This project started as a POC for Client-Server hybrid network scanning for both internal and external testing. However more features were added during the development. All of which can be found in the repos.  

**In my spare time, I'm working on adding more fascinating and useful features, so stay tuned!**
